## VintageousPlus

**VintageousPlus** is a fork of the awesome [Vintageous](https://github.com/guillermooo/Vintageous) plugin for Sublime Text 3. The original author [@guillermooo](https://github.com/guillermooo) doesn't seem to be maintaining it anymore, so this fork steps up to merge outstanding PRs and add some new features.

I don't ever intend to merge this upstream, because I plan on adding some settings and making some changes in the spirit of Atom's [vim-mode-plus](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/wiki/YouDontKnowVimModePlus) that deviate from and improve on standard Vim behaviour when it makes sense. It's my understanding that this is contrary to @guillermooo's philosophy. The Github convention for forks that don't plan on merging is to not have it be a fork on Github, hence the fact that this isn't marked as a fork.
