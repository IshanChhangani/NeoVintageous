### Removed

* Removed: Recursive mappings commands `:map`, `:nmap`, `:omap`, `:smap`, `:vmap`. Use the non recursive commands instead.

  The recursive mappings were removed because they were not implemented as recursive mappings, and removing them now in preference of the non-recursive may prevent some potential problems in the future if the recursive mapping commands are ever implemented.

  Here is a table of the recursive, which have been removed, and the non recursive mapping commands that you can use instead:

  Recursive command | Non recursive command
  ----------------- | ---------------------
  `map` | `noremap`
  `nmap` | `nnoremap`
  `omap` | `onoremap`
  `smap` | `snoremap`
  `vmap` | `vnoremap`
